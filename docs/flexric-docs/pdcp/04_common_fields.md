# Common Fields in `pdcp_rb_stats_impl_t`

This section lists the most commonly available fields inside each Radio Bearer (RB) entry within a PDCP Indication (`ind.rb_stats`).

Each field represents packet statistics collected per bearer per UE. Use this reference to select the most relevant metrics for your application.

## Example Logging (Python)

```python
fields = ['rnti', 'lcid', 'txpdu_bytes', 'rxpdu_bytes', 'txpdu_retx_pkts', 'rxpdu_dup_pkts']

for i, rb in enumerate(ind.rb_stats):
    print(f"\n--- PDCP RB #{i} ---")
    for field in fields:
        value = getattr(rb, field, 'N/A')
        print(f"{field}: {value}")
```

## Notes

* Field availability may depend on your FlexRIC version or plugin compilation
* Always confirm with `dir(ind.rb_stats[0])` or `getattr()` to avoid crashes
* Use subset-based logging for clarity and performance
