# Week of June 17–21, 2025 — OpenAirInterface (5G SA) Documentation

## Weekly Objective

Understand and document the architecture of the OpenAirInterface system in 5G Standalone (SA) mode, as well as the connection chain between the different network components (UE, gNodeB, Core).

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Study of OAI 5G SA Architecture

* Reviewed the official OAI documentation.
* Identified main components: UE, gNB, AMF, SMF, UPF, NRF, AUSF, UDM.

### 2. Diagram Creation

* Designed a clear diagram representing the 5G SA architecture.
* Added arrows between components with interface names.
* Verified the full data path from a smartphone (UE) to the Internet via the 5G Core.

### 3. Technical Discussion

* Confirmed that this architecture matches the one implemented with OpenAirInterface.
* Practical application using available equipment (Quectel modem, USRP if applicable).

## Results

* Solid understanding of the components and their interactions.
* Ready to configure OAI services on dedicated machines (gNodeB, AMF, UPF, etc.).
* Documentation ready for integration into the internship report or technical wiki.
