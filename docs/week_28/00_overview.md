# FlexRIC Integration with OAI 5G SA – Overview

## Project Context

This documentation describes the integration of the FlexRIC platform with a Standalone (SA) 5G testbed using OpenAirInterface (OAI). The primary goal was to collect and analyze real-time radio metrics from a real UE (Quectel RM500Q) connected to a gNB running with USRP B210, and to evaluate the functioning of various xApps in coordination with the Near-RT RIC.

## Objectives

- Deploy and configure OpenAirInterface 5G SA core and gNodeB.
- Integrate FlexRIC’s Near-RT RIC and monitoring xApps.
- Collect metrics such as SNR, MCS, BLER, PRBs, PDCP throughput from live radio traffic.
- Debug and resolve integration issues between OAI and FlexRIC/xApps.
- Export metrics from SQLite for analysis.

## System Architecture

- **gNodeB**: OAI `nr-softmodem` with USRP B210 (Band 78, TDD)
- **Core Network**: OAI CN5G (v2.1.9) deployed with Docker
- **UE**: Quectel RM500Q connected via `quectel-CM`
- **RIC**: FlexRIC compiled from source (latest `main` branch)
- **xApp**: `xapp_gtp_mac_rlc_pdcp_moni` used for collecting MAC, RLC, PDCP, and GTP stats
- **DB**: SQLite DB generated by xApp for metrics

## Key Results

- Successful end-to-end connection between UE and 5G Core via gNB.
- Near-RT RIC and xApp communication established using E2AP over SCTP.
- Real metrics collected and stored in SQLite, accessible and exportable.
- Debugging and fix of crashes due to SQLite constraints on field values.

The next sections of this documentation cover step-by-step procedures, configurations, errors encountered, and solutions applied.
